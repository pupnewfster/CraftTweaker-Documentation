# Skill Bracket Handler

The Skill Bracket Handler gives you access to all the registered skills in Reskillable in the form of a [CTSkill](/Mods/CompatSkills/Custom_Skills/CTSkill). This includes any custom ones you create via the [Custom Skills](/Mods/CompatSkills/Custom_Skills/Custom_Skills) support.

Do note however, that if you are using them on custom skills, make sure the script creating the skill runs first.

You can refer to the Skill Bracket Handler like so:
```
