# Trait Bracket Handler

The Trait Bracket Handler gives you access to all the registered unlockables in Reskillable in the form of a [CTUnlockable](/Mods/CompatSkills/Custom_Traits/CTUnlockable). This includes any custom ones you create via the [Custom Traits](/Mods/CompatSkills/Custom_Traits/Custom_Traits) support, and any ones you create using the GameStage unlockable compat.

Do note however, that if you are using them on custom unlockables, make sure the script creating the unlockable runs first.

You can refer to the Trait Bracket Handler like so:
```
<unlockable:resourcelocation>
```
